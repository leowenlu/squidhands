# What about
I would like a web application framework, I will use aws, my language will be typescript:
- support user authentication with email and password, also with google and facebook and github and twitter etc
- end user can create a profile, and upload a picture, they can edit page, comment on other pages, and like pages
- end user can create a page, and upload a picture, they can edit page, comment on other pages, and like pages
- api for creating pages, and editing pages, and deleting pages
- ecommerce, so I can sell things
- I want to be able to create a blog, and have a blog page, and blog posts

    **Frontend:**
    React.js for building the user interface
    [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for the UI components and styling
    AWS Cognito for user authentication
    **Backend:**
    AWS Lambda for serverless compute
    AWS API Gateway for RESTful API
    AWS DynamoDB for database
    AWS S3 for file storage


Separating infrastructure and source code is a good practice and can help with manageability and scalability. We can use AWS CDK to create separate stacks for your infrastructure and your project source code.

Then I need two git repos, one for the infrastructure, and one for the source code.

# components for the project
As the project involvers both frontend and a backend, the following list of components will be needed:

1. Create a new React.js project using the create-react-app command. This will generate a basic React application that We can use as a starting point.
1. Install and set up [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for your React application. We can refer to the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) documentation for instructions on how to do this.
1. Set up AWS Cognito for user authentication. We can create a new user pool in the AWS Management Console and configure the necessary settings for user authentication.
1. Define the necessary AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints for your backend. We can use AWS CDK to define the infrastructure stack for your backend.
1. Set up AWS DynamoDB for your database. We can define the necessary tables and indexes using AWS CDK.
1. Set up AWS S3 for file storage. We can create a new S3 bucket and configure the necessary permissions for your application.
1. Integrate your frontend and backend components. We can use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to make API calls from your frontend to your backend, and vice versa.1.

## Frontend
### React
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a popular choice for building web applications because it is component-based, which makes it easy to build reusable UI components. It also has a large community of developers, which makes it easy to find solutions to common problems.
- Setup local development environment
    Create a new React.js project
    ```
    npx create-react-app leoonline-frontend
    cd leoonline-frontend
    npm start
    ```

- High level overview of the steps for the frontend to host react.js application on aws Lambda:
While Amazon S3 can host static web content, it doesn't support running server-side code. To host a React.js application on AWS, We will need to use a compute service, such as AWS Lambda or Amazon EC2.
    1. Build your React.js application by running the npm run build command. This will create a production-ready build of your application in the build directory.
        - Store build files in S3 as static website
    1. Set up an Amazon API Gateway REST API to expose your Lambda function as an HTTP endpoint. We can define the necessary API resources and methods using the Amazon API Gateway console or the AWS CLI.
        - AWS Lambda serverless can response quickly to requests
            AWS Lambda is designed to provide high-performance, low-latency compute for serverless applications. When you invoke a Lambda function, AWS automatically provisions a container to run your code, and your code starts executing within a few milliseconds. This means that your Lambda function can respond quickly to requests, without any noticeable delay.
            -   That being said, there are some factors that can affect the performance of your Lambda function. For example, if your function needs to load large dependencies or perform complex initialization, it may take longer to start up. Additionally, if your function needs to access external resources, such as a database or an API, it may be subject to the latency of those resources.
            -   To optimize the performance of your Lambda function, you can take several steps:
            -   Keep your function code small and focused. This will help reduce the time it takes for your function to start up and respond to requests.
            -   Use a smaller runtime environment, such as Node.js, Python, or Java, to reduce the amount of memory and processing power needed to run your function.
            -   Use a content delivery network (CDN) or caching layer to reduce the latency of external resources, such as a database or an API.
            -   Use connection pooling and other optimization techniques to reduce the latency of network requests.
            -   Use asynchronous programming techniques, such as callbacks, promises, or async/await, to make your function more responsive and efficient.
            -   Overall, AWS Lambda is a highly performant and scalable compute service that can handle a wide range of workloads, including hosting React.js applications. By following best practices and optimizing your code and configuration, you can ensure that your Lambda functions respond quickly and reliably to requests.
    1. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to host your static assets, such as your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    1. Configure your S3 bucket to serve as a static website. We can do this using the Amazon S3 console or the AWS CLI.
    1. Update your React.js application to call the API Gateway endpoint for your Lambda function, and to load your static assets from your S3 bucket.
    1. Test your application to make sure it works as expected.
    1. Use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to configure DNS and SSL for your application domain, if desired.
    1. These steps are just a high-level overview, and there are many details that We will need to consider along the way, such as security, performance, and scalability. However, following these steps should give We a good starting point for hosting your React.js application on AWS.

# register an aws account
To register for an AWS account, you can follow these steps:

Go to the AWS website at https://aws.amazon.com/

Click on the "Create an AWS Account" button.

Enter your email address and password, then click "Continue".

Fill in your contact information and payment information, then click "Create Account and Continue".

AWS will now verify your identity. You will need to provide a valid phone number and credit card information. AWS may also call you to verify your identity.

Once your account has been verified, you can log in to the AWS Management Console using your email address and password.

You will need to create an IAM user and generate AWS access keys to use the AWS CLI and AWS CDK. You can refer to the AWS documentation for instructions on how to do this.

Keep in mind that AWS services are charged on a pay-as-you-go basis, so you will be billed for the resources you use. Be sure to monitor your usage and set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.


# setup develope environment

Install Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager) on your machine if you haven't already.

Install the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) on your machine.

Install the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) using npm by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```npm install -g aws-cdk```

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it using your terminal or command prompt.

Initialize your project by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```cdk init app --language=typescript
This will create a new AWS CDK project using TypeScript as the language.```

Open the project in your favorite code editor.

Set up the necessary AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles and permissions that your project will need. You will need to create an IAM user with appropriate permissions and set up your AWS credentials on your local machine using the AWS CLI. You can refer to the AWS documentation for instructions on how to do this.

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start building your application. The next step will be to define the infrastructure stack that your application will run on using AWS CDK.
